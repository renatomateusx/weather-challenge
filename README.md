# weather-challenge
Project made as a quickly challenge

# Used:
URLSession<br/>
Unit Tests<br/>
UI Tests<br/>
SwiftLint<br/>
WeatherAPI<br/>
MVVM Arch

# User Case done:

STORY-1: As a user, I can enter my location into the app
There should be an input field allowing a user to enter a location (a City/state/country/zipcode/etc) into the app.<br/><br/>
STORY-2: As a user, I have a button to retrieve weather info for an entered location
There should be a button labeled “Go!”, “Show”, or similar which uses the input location from STORY-1 to retrieve weather for the given location.
Feel free to use any weather API you want. A few options can be found here:
https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis/blob/master/README.md#weather
Once you’ve made your selection, add a section in your README file explaining the rationale behind your choice. Follow the specification below in order to guide the design and feature-set of your app.<br/><br/>
STORY-3: As a user, I can see the current weather conditions for a location
Using the data retrieved by the action in STORY-2, there needs to be a display of that location’s current weather conditions. The attributes that should be included are:<br/>
● Temperature (in F)<br/>
● Pressure<br/>
● Humidity<br/>
● Current condition (sun, clouds, rain, fog, etc)<br/>
● Chance of precipitation<br/>
